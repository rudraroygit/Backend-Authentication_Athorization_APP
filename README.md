# Backend-Authentication_Athorization_APP

Project Overview
This project provides a foundation for building a secure authentication system using MongoDB and Express. It includes the necessary files and structure to set up the system, define routes, connect to the database, and handle user authentication.

Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

index.js: This is the main file that creates the Express app, sets up middleware functions, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines routes.

./config/database.js: This file exports a function that establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

./routes/user.js: This file defines the routes related to user authentication, including login, signup, and protected routes. It also includes middleware functions to check the JWT (JSON Web Token) and the user's role.

./models/User.js: This file defines the User schema for the MongoDB database using the Mongoose Schema constructor. It specifies the structure and properties of the user data.

./middleware/auth.js: This file exports middleware functions used to validate the JWT and check the user's role for protected routes.

./controllers/Auth.js: This file exports functions that handle user login and signup requests. It contains the logic to authenticate users and manage their authentication tokens.

Technologies Used
MongoDB: The project utilizes MongoDB as the database to store user information securely.

Express: The Express framework is used to build the server-side application and define routes for handling user authentication.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install the required dependencies: npm install
Configure the MongoDB connection in the ./config/database.js file.
